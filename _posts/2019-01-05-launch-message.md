Welcome to my blog, my name is Dylan and I'm a Software Engineer currently working in the FinTech industry focusing on securing the web. This site is going to be a place where I plan to share thoughts and ideas all within the technology ecosystem.

I'm primarily a web developer by trade, which will tend to skew this blog towards more of this category, but I plan to expand my skill set and share the knowledge here.
