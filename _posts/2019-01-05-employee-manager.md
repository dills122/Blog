Welcome to the first post of my blog in which I will go one of my basic app's I started with when learing single page application frameworks (SPAs). This app was built with Vue.js, which in my opinion is the best option for beginners.

If you're interested in building a similar app checkout Traverse Media's [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYsOOycB67Raf9dwmL6Y31M).

Also, if you wanted to play around with my demo app, check it out [here](https://dills122.github.io/Employee-Manager/#/).
